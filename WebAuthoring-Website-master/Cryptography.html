		Cryptography in Internet
	</h1>
	<p>
		Cryptography is most important part of network to keep user datas in secure. Cryptography is science about keeping data in secure if enemy know about them.
		Now we know about this types of cryptography protocols:
		<table class="CryptoTypes">
			<tr>
				<th>Symmetric-key cryptography protocols</th>
				<th>Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both the encryption of plaintext and the decryption of ciphertext.
				     The keys may be identical, or there may be a simple transformation to go between the two keys.</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>
					Public-key cryptography protocols
				</th>
				<th>
					Public-key cryptography is the field of cryptographic systems that use pairs of related keys. 
					Each key pair consists of a public key and a corresponding private key. 
					Key pairs are generated with cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems termed one-way functions.
				</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>
					Quantum cryptography algorithm
				</th>
				<th>
					Quantum cryptography is the science of exploiting quantum mechanical properties to perform cryptographic tasks.
					The best known example of quantum cryptography is quantum key distribution which offers an information-theoretically
					secure solution to the key exchange problem.

		Public-key cryptography
	</h2>
	<p>
		Public-key Cryptography algprithm mostly are based on two different types of keys - public key and private key.
		Public-key are using to share with person for encrypt message what he want to send and private key are needed to decrypt this message.
		Public-key cryptography are based on hard to solve mathematical problems, for example RSA algorithm are based on "factoring problem".
		There is some most popular algorithms what using around the Internet:

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>RSA</th>
				<th> 2048 to 4096 bit </th>
				<th> In a public-key cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and distinct from the decryption key, which is kept secret (private).
				     An RSA user creates and publishes a public key based on two large prime numbers, along with an auxiliary value. 
				     The prime numbers are kept secret. Messages can be encrypted by anyone, via the public key, but can only be decoded by someone who knows the prime numbers.</th>

				<th>DSA</th>
				<th style=" width:150px;"> Private: 160-256 bit <br>
				     Public: 1024-3072 bit</th>
				<th>DSA is a public-key cryptosystem and Federal Information Processing Standard for digital signatures,
				    based on the mathematical concept of modular exponentiation and the discrete logarithm problem.</th>

			<tr>
				<th>ElGamal </th>
				<th> 4096 bit</th>
				<th>Asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography which is based on the Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange.
				    It was described by Taher Elgamal in 1985.</th>
