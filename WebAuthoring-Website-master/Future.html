	<p>
		In the realm of quantum communication, one wants to send qubits from one quantum processor to another over long distances.
		This way, local quantum networks can be intra connected into a quantum internet.
		A quantum internet supports many applications, which derive their power from the fact that by creating quantum entangled qubits, information can be transmitted between the remote quantum processors.
		Most applications of a quantum internet require only very modest quantum processors.
		For most quantum internet protocols, such as quantum key distribution in quantum cryptography, it is sufficient if these processors are capable of preparing and measuring only a single qubit at a time.
		This is in contrast to quantum computing where interesting applications can only be realized if the (combined) quantum processors can easily simulate more qubits than a classical computer (around 60).
		Quantum internet applications require only small quantum processors, often just a single qubit, because quantum entanglement can already be realized between just two qubits.
		A simulation of an entangled quantum system on a classical computer cannot simultaneously provide the same security and speed.

	<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>

	<p>
		Artificial Intelligence in computing is self-learning algorithm.
		There have different types of Artificial intelligence - machine learning, neural network,
		Deep learning Genetic algorithm more and more.
		<br>
		Different algorithms are needed to solve different problems starting from raw data analysing ending with fouding persons face in millions of video records.
		That mean that in closest future in Internet not gone be need anymore remote workers who sorting out datas, writting text or doing some other easy but routine job.
		And that not good, because that houndred thousends of the people will just lose their job.
