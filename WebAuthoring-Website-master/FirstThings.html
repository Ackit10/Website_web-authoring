		First Large size network - ArpaNet
	</h1>
	<p>
		To start off what Arpanet stands for is the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, what it was, was the first wide-area packet-switched
		network with distributed control and one of the first networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. With bothe of these types of technology being used on what we now would be referring to the internet.
	</p>
	<p>
		This whole project was being funded by the United States Department of Defence all the way back in 1965. The main goal of this project was to create a network without computers being connected to dedicated phones.
		A really big reason on why the Arpanet project was so important was because it was the first public packet-switched computer network. The main purpose of Arpanet was for mainly academic and research purposes.

	<p>
		Arpanet was formally decommissioned in the 1990â€™s,
		after the partnerships with the telecommunication and computer industry had assured private sector expansion and future commercialization of an expanded world-wide network, known as the Internet. So it got outclased.
