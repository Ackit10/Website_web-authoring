		My Opinion about web page
	</h1>
	<p>
		This was pretty hard project, a lot of work need be to create this site and need be spend a lot of time to design and developing this project.
		In this is second variant of my website - first version I have to be drop because that there was "spagetty code" what was hard to continue to developing and debuging,
		that mean this project teach me some important things what I will use in my future project.
		One of this thing is - split project in mulitply files. In my previes version main problem was too large code and because in second version I split project in multiply files, 
		This give chance for easier developing and make project very easy to debuging.
		This is my opinion about my website.
