	<h1> Protocols what are using in World Wide Web</h1>

	<h2>TCP/IP</h2>
	<p>
		TCP/IP is a stream protocol. This means that a connection is negotiated between a client and a server.
		Any data transmitted between these two endpoints is guaranteed to arrive, thus it is a so-called lossless protocol.
		Since the TCP protocol (as it is also referred to in short form) can only connect two endpoints, it is also called a peer-to-peer protocol.
	</p>
	<hr width="100%" color="black" align="center" />
	<h2>UDP/IP</h2>
	<p>
		UDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms.
		UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions
		at the source and destination of the datagram

	<h2>HTTP/HTTPS</h2>
	<p>
		HTTP is the protocol used to transmit all data present on the World Wide Web. This includes text, multimedia and graphics.
		It is the protocol used to transmit HTML

	<h2>FTP</h2>
	<p>
		Standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server
		to a client on a computer network. FTP is built on a clientâ€“server model architecture using
		separate control and data connections between the client and the server.
